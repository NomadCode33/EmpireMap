# Map of New York
Labeled a street map of New York by employing label classes and utilizing queries to target and label specific subsets of features. Additionally, I created an optimized layout for the map, ensuring clear and effective presentation.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ArcGIS Pro

The map starts off as a jubbled mess of labels that need to be sorted accordingly

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
